### Unparalleled Passive Income Possibilities

FEG Staking is a protocol that allows FEG token holders to stake their tokens and earn rewards from the entire FEG ecosystem on that chain, with the potential for significant gains over time.

### Features of staking contract

<table data-card-size="large" data-column-title-hidden data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Zero fees</td><td>No deposit or withdrawal fees for staking your FEG, it's free</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>No lock-in periods</td><td>FEG allows you to stake and unstake at anytime, total freedom</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Automatic compounding</td><td>Your rewards get auto distributed &#x26; compounded to gain even more over time</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Upgradeable</td><td>The contract requires no action from users when staking contract gets upgraded</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### **Staking rewards sources**

FEG Token stakers will earn rewards exclusively in FEG Token until other platforms are released, at which point they may receive native assets for fees.

### **What is FST**

```

After staking, your FEG tokens will be deposited into the staking contract, and you will receive "FEG Staking" (FST) shares in return. These shares represent your ownership in the staking pool. Think of FST as a receipt from the system confirming your successful stake. You must present this receipt to the system to unstake your tokens.

* FST is not a 1:1 ratio
* FST number does not increase with rewards
* Total FST / Total FEG = Ratio
* It is impossible to transfer FST to another wallet

### Non-FEG Rewards (future)

Non-FEG rewards refer to wBNB/wETH rewards earned from FEG's Non-custodial P2P trading platform, "FTW," and fees from the custom-built Aggregator.

### Reward Distribution (future)

Non-FEG rewards will be given in rounds and subject to a certain accumulation threshold.\
\
Developers can modify the accumulation threshold for each of the rewards.\
\
For example, if 1 wBNB is the threshold, rewards disburse when the reward pool is above 1 wBNB.

{% hint style="info" %}
Unstaking or adding to your stake within 30 days after your initial staking will result in a 50% loss of your non-FEG rewards.\
\
The forfeited rewards will be redistributed among the other stakeholders.
{% endhint %}

### Optional FEG "Sacrifice"

The new staking contract introduced the sacrifice feature at the community's request. It allows those who wish to contribute to burn efforts to reduce the circulating token supply.\
\
When unstaking, Stakers can voluntarily burn a specified percentage of their FEG rewards, permanently removing these tokens from circulation.\
\
To activate this feature, specify the percentage you wish to sacrifice.

{% hint style="success" %}
At any point before unstaking, you can turn off the sacrifice by setting it to 0%
{% endhint %}

### Platform Expansion

* Currently available on Ethereum, BNB and BASE blockchains
* The team plans to expand the sources of income for FEG investors by expanding FEG and SmartDeFi to several new EVM-based blockchains.
