# ðŸ“ˆ FEG Tokenomics

## #1 - Supply info

The entire supply of FEG is 100 billion tokens, and it is a unified singular supply across ETH, BNB, and BASE chains, meaning people can freely move tokens between their blockchains of choice.\
The total supply will decrease because FEG continues to burn through tokenomics taxes.

### Tokenomics Overview

FEG incorporates tokenomics designed to align with the project's current growth objectives and propel it forward during the next crypto bull market. It ensures the project will have the necessary funds to become a household name and a leading DeFi project.

The tokenomics structure is as follows:

1. **Staking Rewards**:&#x20;
   * 1.3% of buys and sells are allocated to the [staking pool](../feg-staking/) as rewards for token holders who stake their tokens. This feature supports the project's focus on passive income.&#x20;
2. **Asset-Backed Liquidity**:
   * 0.5% of buys and 1% of sells contribute to an [asset-backed](../../smartdefi-tm-platform/smartdefi-protocol/asset-backing.md) liquidity pool. The asset-backing pool continuously grows in the form of the asset used to back the Token; this allows token holders to either burn their Token for the backing amount or take an interest-free [loan](../../smartdefi-tm-platform/smartdefi-protocol/smartlending.md) against their holdings.
3. **Marketing and Development Budget**:
   * The marketing and development budget allocates 0.5% of buys and 1% of sales. These funds promote the project and support development, ensuring and maintaining the project's ecosystem infrastructure (_servers, Web3 infrastructure, etc._).
4. **Liquidity Pool Expansion**:
   * 0.5% of buys and 1.5% of sells contribute to expanding the project's liquidity pool. Adding to liquidity ensures greater stability in the Token's price impact, especially during significant buying, selling, and activity periods.
5. **Burn to decrease supply**:
   * To ensure the project circulating supply will keep decreasing, 0.2% of buys and sells will auto-buy and burn FEG and inject the backing back into the asset backing pool
