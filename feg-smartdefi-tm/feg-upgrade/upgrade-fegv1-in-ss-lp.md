# âŒ› Upgrade FEGv1 in SS/LP

There are still users with old FEG v1 stored in SmartSwap or Liquidity Pools on the old FEGex. The FEG team devised a solution to help them upgrade these locked funds.

Due to their insecure nature, those smart contracts could not be added to the regular automatic Upgrade app that others use. Therefore, our developers built a special tool for users with FEG v1 in SmartSwap and LP to upgrade to the new contract. This tool is simple and easy to use.

You can find the SS & LP upgrade tool here: [https://sslp.fegtoken.com/](https://sslp.fegtoken.com/)

This tool burns your old tokens in SmartSwap and LP, making you eligible to be airdropped in the new FEG in exchange.

After using the tool, contact any of our admins in the Telegram support chat. Let them know you've used the tool and provide the hash for your burn transaction. Our admins will then place you on the list of people to be airdropped in the new FEG.

{% hint style="success" %}
IMPORTANT: The airdrops are done in batches, about once every couple of months, so there will be a waiting period after you send the transaction hash.
