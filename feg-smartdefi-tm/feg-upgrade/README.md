### Why Upgrade to FEG-SD V3?

FEG Token has been upgraded to our cutting-edge SmartDeFi technology, transforming it from a simple token into a powerful DeFi platform. This evolution brings a wealth of features, including a unified supply across multiple blockchains, bridging capabilities, asset backing, SmartLending, and a new staking system with immense potential for passive income, among other advancements.

### Upgrade FEG on Centralized Exchanges (CEXs)

If you had a previous version of FEG Token on a centralized exchange (CEX) platform like Gate, the migration process was automatic, and you didn't need to take any additional action.

### Upgrade FEG in your wallet

If you hold old FEG in your wallet, you can use our user-friendly upgrade UI for seamless token swapping by following these steps:

1. Visit the official page for the upgrade: [https://smartdefi.com](https://smartdefi.com)
2. Find the Upgrade tab, which is designed to be intuitive and straightforward to use.
3. Upgrade steps are similar across different platforms; you can use any DeFi wallet you prefer.

Remember to never respond to any direct messages (DMs) claiming to be from the FEG team, as those are 100% scams.

### How to Upgrade FEG

Visit [SmartDeFi.com](https://smartdefi.com/bsc/token/0xF3c7CECF8cBC3066F9a87b310cEBE198d00479aC/\(chart/secondary:upgrader\)) and connect your wallet. \
On FEG's page, click on the "Upgrader" tab. Here, you will see the amount of FEG v1 (including staked) and FEG v2 that you own and the amount of new FEG you will receive in exchange for these old tokens.

Click "Approve" and after transaction executes, refresh page to make sure, then hit the "Upgrade all" button to give your old tokens and receive new ones in exchange.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that you may only perform the upgrade once per wallet! \
If you want to use the upgrader again, use a different wallet !
{% endhint %}

#### Sidenote about upgrading

You can also choose to upgrade and then have your new FEG bridged to another chain. \
The upgrade tool will take your old owned FEG and unlock the new FEG on your chosen chain.

You will then need to withdraw your upgraded FEG on the other chain you chose. \
To do so, change the network in your wallet, click the "Bridge" tab, then the "Withdrawals" tab, and finally click the "Withdraw" button.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Remember, you need native coins for gas fees on the origin and destination chains.

Gas fees for bridge use are higher than normal transactions!
{% endhint %}

With just a few clicks, you upgraded your FEG tokens and bridged to a new chain.

### General info about upgrading

* If your FEG v2 was staked, your tokens were automatically upgraded. You'll see your new FEG tokens securely staked when you check the staking page.
* If your FEG v2 was not staked and held in your wallet, you must manually upgrade your tokens. You can also bridge your new FEG to another chain during this process.
* If you still have old FEG v1 _(staked or not),_ you must manually upgrade and choose your desired blockchain where to receive the new FEG. Note that FEG v1 to v3 is a 1.000.000:1 ratio, but don't worry, you'll own precisely the same _percentage_ of FEG; as such, you won't lose any money

### The end time for the upgrade

The upgrade from the old FEG to the new FEG is open-ended and does not have a set end time.\
When the team decides on a conclusion time, you will find that info here.
