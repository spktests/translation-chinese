You can switch two themes if you click the Old theme at the bottom of the application.

## 2. The menu moved to the bottom

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/photo_16_2022-12-08_13-34-36.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can find direct links at the bottom of the app to vote on Coinmarketcap and Coingeco. Below, you can find direct links to buy FEGtoken from platforms such as Uniswap, PancakeSwap, or Fiat.\
\
Lower down the page, and you will find links to the various social media maintained by the FEGtoken project. Lastly, you will find the app version that you have installed.

## 3. Add your wallet(s)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Add wallet.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

FEGtrack is safe; it does NOT connect to your wallet; it simply reads holdings info from your public wallet address, which is 0x...

Anyone on the blockchain can see public wallet addresses.\
\
\-Click the + sign and copy/paste your wallet's public address in the "wallet address" field.\
\-Then, you will name your wallet.\
\-This name will appear at the top of the app once saved.\
\
You can also add your wallet address by scanning the QR code inside.\
\
Once done, click the Save Wallet button to save your wallet inside FEGtrack.

## 4.  Change the Network

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/photo_11_2022-12-08_13-34-36.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Near the top of the screen, there is a network icon that allows you to change your wallet between the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain networks. \
\
Be sure to pick the correct network for the FEG tokens you own. Otherwise, your balance may indicate zero; don't panic if it does; change the network.

## &#x20;5.  Change between balances

Clicking repeatedly on the "Total balance" button will toggle your dashboard and show you the various balances you hold.\
\
The button's text and dashboard statistics will change as follows:\
1\. Total  /  2. Wallet  /  3. Stake v2  /  4. Stake v1

## 6. Market data

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/market data.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Scroll down, and you will find the "market data" section, where you will be presented with market cap, volume, price, amounts burned, and circulation statistics.\
\
If you press on sections 2, 3, 4, and 6, they will switch the display to show more data (for example, FEG burned will switch to FEG Circulating %).\
\
Try it out!

## 7. Transactions&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/photo_15_2022-12-08_13-34-36.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Further down in the application, you will be met with the "transactions" section, where you will see a horizontally scrollable live list of the most recent buy and sell FEGtoken transactions.\
\
If you press on "Transactions," it will switch to "My transactions." It might take a while to load up and will display your transactions with FEG token. It will not show transfers, only buys and sells. \


## 8. Change Font Size

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/increase font.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you press the FEGtrack logo at the top for a few seconds, the app will switch to a larger font for those who have smaller screens. You can change to the default font size by pressing the logo again.

## 9. Hide Balance

You can hide your Balance if you click on the left icon that looks like an eye. Market data and transactions will still be displayed.
