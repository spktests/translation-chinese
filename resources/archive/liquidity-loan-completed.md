# ðŸ’¼ Liquidity Loan \[Completed]

## Repayment Total = 100% Repaid (October 16, 2024).



### On March 13th, 2023, FEG secured a loan for 200 ETH converted into BNB to replenish the FEGbsc liquidity pool for the new token contract post-migration.

## Loan Details:

* This loan will be paid back as 200 ETH (The form it was given in).
* A flat fee of $50,000 USD in interest will be paid to the LP provider.

## Loan Repayment Contract:

The FEG (Feed Every Gorilla) team has established a new contract, setting out a plan for allocating 50% of FEG's liquidity, encompassing both FEGeth and FEGbsc tokens. Under this arrangement, the liquidity provider (LP) lender can claim a portion of this liquidity bi-weekly.

**Key Features of the Contract:**

1. **Bi-Weekly Claims:** The LP lender is authorized to claim up to 10% of the allocated 50% liquidity every two weeks from each chain (FEGeth & FEGbsc).\
   \- Note: BNB withdrawn from FEGbsc liquidity will be converted into ETH to maintain an accurate repayment count.
2. **Strategic Liquidity Management:** This phased claiming process is designed to provide sufficient time for the FEG token's price to potentially increase. The goal is to use less than the total allocated 50%, with the remaining liquidity eventually being returned to the FEG liquidity pool, thus preserving and stabilizing the overall liquidity.

## LP Contract Implemented

The LP contract has now been fully audited and tested. The FEG developers have successfully implemented the contract and transferred a portion of the LP into it, as evident in the following transactions:\

## **Addressing Thinning Liquidity: "Bonding" Liquidity Solution**

In response to the potential thinning of liquidity due to these withdrawals, FEGrox has developed an innovative "bonding" contract. This contract allows users to contribute ETH or BNB, which will be paired with the unpaired FEG Tokens following the liquidity withdrawals by the lender.

**Bonding Contract Details:**

* **Duration:** The bonds will have a term of one year.
* **Return on Bond:** At the end of this period, users will receive back their "bonded" ETH or BNB, along with the equivalent amount of FEG tokens they contributed to the pair.
* **Risk Awareness:** Participants should be aware of the possibility of impermanent loss, a common risk for all liquidity providers.

The "bonding" contract represents a strategic approach to bolster the liquidity pool and mitigate the effects of liquidity withdrawal by the lender. This approach not only aids in maintaining a healthy liquidity level but allows users to contribute to and benefit from the FEG ecosystem.

Further information regarding this "bonding" mechanism will be released in due course, including details about its testing and auditing. This proactive measure demonstrates FEG's commitment to maintaining robust liquidity and a stable ecosystem for its users and investors.

## Tokenomics

[Tokenomics](../../feg-smartdefi-tm/about-feg-token/feg-tokenomics.md) were adjusted to feed the project's needs, including raising the total tax to incorporate a Liquidity Injection tax that would help stabilize the liquidity during loan repayment.

## How to calculate Tokenomics-driven Liquidity Injections

We made it so that the user can look at the blockchain and see the stored funds; as such, the funds gathered by the taxes for repayment of the loan are held directly inside the token contract.\
The funds are stored inside the FEG contract as LP tokens.\
\
**BSC LP Contract Address**:\
[https://bscscan.com/address/0xF53a1d602281B1ce2A92A1763364d2981269a72C](https://bscscan.com/address/0xF53a1d602281B1ce2A92A1763364d2981269a72C)\
**ETH LP Contract Address**:\
[https://etherscan.io/address/0x60EF1e0Bf9218Cdc1769a43c4B0B111ed38BB418](https://etherscan.io/address/0x60EF1e0Bf9218Cdc1769a43c4B0B111ed38BB418)\
\
To calculate how much BNB/ETH is gathered inside those LP tokens:\
1\. Hit the token drop-down button to view the total BNB or ETH amount in the LP contract\
2\. Click on Pancake LP (BSC) or Uniswap V2 (ETH) under "Token Tracker."\
3\. Click on the "Holders" tab\
4\. Locate the FEG contract address (`0xbededDf2eF49E87037c4fb2cA34d1FF3D3992A11`) which should be the #2 wallet holder\
5\. Scroll to the right and note the percentage the #2 wallet (FEG contract) holds\
6\. Multiply that percentage by the total BNB or ETH in the LP contract to find how much has been generated in Loan repayment.
