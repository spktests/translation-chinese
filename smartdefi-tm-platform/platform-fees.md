# ðŸ’² Platform fees

The SmartDeFi platform was built to have as many features as possible, for a decentralized ecosystem, but at the same time we wanted it to be as near to free-to-use as possible.

As such the platform is crammed with features and systems all gathered in one easy to use package, that you will not find anywhere else, all for little to no cost at all for DEVs and investors alike.

### Platform fees for DEVs&#x20;

* Launching a SmartDeFi projects is completely FREE, you only need to cover the chain gas fees.&#x20;
* For LGE (Presales), a minimum of 30% from raised funds will buy and pair FEG in secondary LP with vesting from 35 days up to 5 years, depending on your chosen LP claims settings.
* Launching SmartBridge (for your tokens is FREE, you only need to cover the chain gas fees.
* Enabling the Staking system costs 100$ worth of FEG, which will be burned.&#x20;
* Activating the Fee Converter costs 100$ worth of FEG, which will be burned.&#x20;

### Platform fees for users&#x20;

* 0.5% of tokens when adding to staking&#x20;
* 1$ in natives when using SmartBridge&#x20;
* 0.5% protocol fee on buys and sells; this fee can be lower under certain conditions, if project X has:\
  \- LP smaller but above 25% of FEG's LP, their tax gets lowered to 0.4% \
