### Creating Your Token with Ease

Creating your token becomes a straightforward process with simple visit to [SmartDeFi.com](https://smartdefi.com)\
\
The "Launch SD" button in the left menu unlocks the "Create SmartDeFi Token" window, where you can mint and customize your token, all in one simple window.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/create SD main.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Tailor your project with various parameters, offering unparalleled flexibility for your unique needs.\
The token creation menu offers you control over options such as:\
\- **Token name, for** example: Bitcoin (only use letters/numbers).\
\- **Token symbol**, for example: BTC.\
\- **Supply** of your token, up to a maximum of 5 quintillion.\
\- **Backing** tax will inject funds into your asset backing pool with every trade.\
\- **Backing asset:** Address of desired coin/token for backing; by default, it will input **wBNB/wETH**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note: The SmartDeFi protocol works best with 1e18 decimals types of assets used for asset backing but you can choose assets with less decimals.**&#x20;

**If you intend to launch LGE, the amount of decimals in assets chosen for asset backing will determine if LGE participants get a share of asset backing during Claim Shares or not.**&#x20;

**Assets from asset backing with less than 1e15 decimals will likely not be distributed during LGE Claim Share events (LGE participants would still get the liquidity shares as intended). The tokens with asset backing that has less than 15 decimals can still be utilized for trading, for SmartLoans,  Burn for Backing or other SmartDeFi functionality. Only LGE side of things will be impacted by the choice of the assets for asset backing with less than 15 decimals.**
{% endhint %}

\
\- **Burn tax:** if you'd like to burn tokens automatically while trading\
\- **Liquidity** tax: this will inject BNB/ETH and your SD token into your liquidity pool, thus helping to strengthen the depth of your liquidity.\
\- **Growth** tax: SD tokens will be sent to the SD-owner wallet with each trade, and teams can use these funds for marketing, team payment, CEX listings, and whatever they need to run the project.\
\- **Staking** tax: sends SD-tokens rewards to those using the SmartDeFi staking platform.\
\- **Reflections** tax: to reward holders frictionlessly with small amounts of SD-tokens on every trade.\
\- **Different taxation:** Project creators can set different tax levels for buys and sales.\
\-- Note: "**Tax on transfers**" will use by default the same tax settings from buys.\
\-- **Limits**: All taxes combined cannot be more than 50% for buying and 50% for selling.

{% hint style="success" %}
**The Protocol Fee** is a small tax of 0.5% that the DEV team will use to continue building, updating and growing the ecosystem and rewarding users. \
So if you set your custom taxes to 5%, total will be 5.5% with protocol fee.

**Under certain conditions the Protocol fee of 0.5% can be reduced up to 0.1% based off the liquidity size or asset backing. See more details** [**here**](../platform-fees.md)
{% endhint %}

Once satisfied with the chosen settings, a simple click on the "Create Token" button initiates the process. Approval from the wallet app and covering blockchain gas fees for the transaction completes the token creation journey.

Congratulations, you're now the happy owner of a crypto project, and at this point, you'll notice you have received the entire supply of this new token in your wallet.

### Options for Liquidity: Your Choice, Your Launch

The next step is to launch your project publicly, and to do that, SmartDeFi Launchpad gives project owners the flexibility to choose between a [public LEAP fundraising](presale-launch/lge-for-devs.md) to gather liquidity or to launch first and manually [add liquidity later](private-liquidity-launch.md) from the owner's wallet.

If you're not using a presale launch, manually adding liquidity is essential for your token to be publicly traded on PancakeSwap or Uniswap.

### Post Creation Menu

Post-token creation, project owners gain access to a comprehensive dashboard equipped with various settings related to token liquidity, presale launch, adding asset backing, enabling staking, editing taxes, adding project logo, token information, social links and so on.&#x20;

### • **Adding Logo and Description**

### • **Add Asset Backing**

If you have funds available in your wallet, you can manually inject funds into the asset-backing pool for your project at any time.\
If not, leave it as is, and the pool will slowly fill up automatically due to the backing tax you set earlier in the token creation window.

### • **Edit Taxes**&#x20;

If you forgot to create an asset backing tax earlier, during token creation, then no worries, you can edit any of your project's taxes even after token creation, as per your needs, using the "Edit tax" button. \
\- Note: You cannot change taxes on the fly; from one minute to another, a delay is designed to protect investors. You can change taxes however many times you wish in the coming years, but you cannot activate these newly edited taxes for the next three days after you've suggested the new taxes. Return to this menu after the timer runs out and activate the new taxes. Otherwise, your project will keep using the old taxes.\
\
Using this "edit tax" option will display a public warning on your token's page in FEGex to notify investors of your action to change the project's tokenomics.\
\
You will also gain access to an advanced tool called [SDscan](sdscan-tool/), which gives you unprecedented control over the inner workings of your new token project, allowing you to read the info and modify your token (within limits) in the token's smart contract.
