# ðŸ“– SDscan tool

<mark style="color:orange;">**This page is under development**</mark>

SDscan is a comprehensive tool build by FEG team to expand functional abilities for SD project owners and investors by allowing information inquiry and submission of changes for a specific project.

SDscan works similar to blockchain explorers with web3 connection and ability to READ contracts and WRITE to contracts. Everything that is available on Project Dashboards is built with usage of Read and Write commands, so you should be able to manage or interrogate your project on SDscan.

<mark style="color:yellow;">READ function</mark> - the place where you can confirm ownership wallets, addresses and thresholds for LP and Asset Backing conversions and many more. This is available to everyone, so investors can use this section to confirm various info related to a project.

<mark style="color:yellow;">WRITE function</mark> - allows submitting commands to smart contracts in SmartDefi protocol to implement changes. This is the place where you can change ownership, change thresholds for LP and Asset Backing conversions, set new staking rewards and implement many other changes.
