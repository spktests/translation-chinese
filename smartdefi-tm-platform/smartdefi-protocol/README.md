# ðŸŒŸ SmartDeFi Protocol

### **Unleash the Power of SmartDeFi**

SmartDeFi is a next-gen Token Launchpad developed by the [FEG](https://fegtoken.com/) Team, led by the renowned developer [FEGrox](https://twitter.com/lifeisdefi), and [audited](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit\_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-FEG-SmartDeFi-v1.1.pdf) by independent security experts like [Peckshield](https://peckshield.com/) and [Sourcehat](https://sourcehat.com/).

Creating SmartDeFi was a massive undertaking that spanned several years, involved over 100 developers, testers, and auditors, and cost over a million dollars in development.

SmartDeFi, or SD, allows users to create arguably the most advanced crypto tokens on the market. It features a singular supply on multiple blockchains, such as BSC, ETH, and BASE, with plans for further expansion.

This cutting-edge technology is available free of charge through the SmartDeFi Token Launchpad.
